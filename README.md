# PLEO-Theater-Demo

Insert the microSD card (in a case in PLEO’s box), and you can run the following actions and commands.

Sensor | Action
-------|-------
Top of Head | PLEO will lean forward and roar. Then, he will say his line
Chin | PLEO will do his celebration dance for the end of the skit.

Also, you can leave the SD card out and use PLEO’s default personality for demoing.

Pressing the power button once will turn PLEO off.


Look at the [guide](Guide.md) for more information on programming for PLEO.
